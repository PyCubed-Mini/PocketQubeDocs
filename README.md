# PocketQube Documentation
[wiki lives here](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/NewDocumentation/wiki)

[new docs](https://pocketqube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Building the new docs

In the `docs/` folder, run `make html`.
If things aren't working running `make clean` (in the same folder) is often a good idea.

## Viewing the new docs

Using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) you can run `live-server build/html`.
